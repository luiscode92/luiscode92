### Hi there 👋

#### Me
As a Full Stack Software Engineer with +5 years of experience developing digital products for startups, I specialize in using technologies such as Javascript, NodeJS, ReactJS, and various UI frameworks to create robust and scalable applications.

With a proactive and energetic approach to development, I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with great teams to achieve both personal and company goals.

My passion for IA and LLMs has led me to focus on creating innovative solutions using these technologies. I am excited to contribute my skills to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
